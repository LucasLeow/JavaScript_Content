    - 4 technologies used to make interactive web app
    - Full stack

    MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
        - Stores data

    ExpressJS (BackEnd)
        - handle requests (Authentication etc.)
        - Express app running in NodeJS environment
        - framework for Node to create easy API

    ReactJS (FrontEnd)
        - Render Components in Browser
        - Handles routing in browser (show different webpages)
        
    NodeJS (Runtime + BackEnd)


    1) React makes request to Express
    2) Express process request then interacts with MongoDB
        - authenticate users
        - perform CRUD on DB
    3) Send response back to React
        - typically JSON
    4) React output data on template

    Purpose of Express | Node instead of React direct to Mongo
        - to prevent exposing sensitive data to front-end code
        - hides sensitive code from front-end
