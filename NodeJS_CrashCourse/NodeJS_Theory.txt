== 1 Intro & Setup ==
    
    - What is NodeJS

        - JS Runtime environment to run JS on computers
            - written in C++, wraps around V8 Engine
                - V8 Engine written in C++ by Google team, embedded in Chrome

        - Read & Write files on computers
        - Connect to database
        - Act as server for content

        - Lose access to DOM
            - cannot interact with HTML element using NodeJS
            - cannot use document.querySelector in Node
                - document part of "window" object


    Benefits of Node as BackEnd
        - No need to learn extra language for Backend (if alrdy familiar)
        - share code b/w front-end & back-end
        - massive community, library & frameworks


== 2 Node.js Basics ==


    -- 2.1 global object in NodeJS --
        (https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#global-objects)
        
        - Inside browser, known as "window" object
            - load of methods & properties accessible

        - Inside Node, known as "global" object
            - don't have to use "global" prefix (implied)

            i.e setTimeout() instead of global.setTimeout()



    -- 2.2 modules & require --

        - modules are simply JS files
        - need separate modules to keep code neat (modularity)
        - require() will simply execute js file, no data imported / exported
        
        inside people.js:
            const people = ['person1', 'person2'];
            const ages = [20, 23];

            module.exports = {
                people,
                ages
            };

        inside main.js:

            const data = require('./people');
            console.log(data.people, data.ages);


        Destructuring objects:
            - must be same name as property exported
        
        eg:

        inside main.js:

            const { people, ages } = require('./people');

            console.log(people);


        Core modules in JS:
            - also known as built-in modules (ships with Node) 
            (https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/ref_modules.asp)

                assert
                buffer
                child_process
                cluster
                crypto
                dgram
                dns
                domain
                events
                fs
                http
                https
                net
                os
                path
                punycode
                querystring
                readline
                stream
                string_decoder
                timers
                tls
                tty
                url
                util
                v8
                vm
                zlib
